## Contents Overview:
This repository includes 3 folders:
- The DATA folder contains the .csv file that holds our data as well as a data dictionary
- The FIGURES folder contains the figures produced throughout our analysis
- The SRC folder contains the source code for our analysis

## SRC Folder:
### Installing and Building
Download any files in this section to your local computer. These files are written in Python, and it is recommended to use Visual Studio Code to execute.

### Usage
- First download the code file(s) from the SRC folder and the .csv file from the  DATA folder.
- The only piece of code that will need to be edited for correct usage is the file path. This appears on line ___ of ___ file. Edit the path provided to the location of where you downloaded the .csv file on your local computer.
- Code should be run line by line if you wish to see all visualizations/plots.

## DATA Folder:

### Data Collection Process
The data we used for this project was sourced from Letterboxd. We transformed this data into HTML files containing film names, posters, and genre. This is labeled as _________. These were created by scraping data from Letterboxd film genre lists and grouping them with their respective film names and posters.

### Access

### Dictionary

### Data Context
We wanted to develop a model that could predict movie genre based on its poster. Our data was scraped from a multiple user-generated movie lists on Letterboxd, "a social media website for film lovers." Letterboxd contains accurate film data for over 3 million of its users to share, track, and save for later.
